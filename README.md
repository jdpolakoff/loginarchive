# Misty Mountain Radio / Loginapp mashup

This is a music streaming [app](https://github.com/jdpolakoff/archive) built on top of a user login and registration app using Node.js, Express, Passport and Mongoose. The login functionality comes from a YouTube series of tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ktxiqyiLA). To build on top of the User model that came from the tutorial, I added a Fave model that is as an embedded array in the User Mongoose schema. 

### Installation

App requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

```sh
$ npm install
```

```sh
$ npm start
```
